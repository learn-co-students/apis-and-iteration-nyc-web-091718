  # NOTE: in this demonstration we name many of the variables _hash or _array.
  # This is done for educational purposes. This is not typically done in code.


  # iterate over the response hash to find the collection of `films` for the given
  #   `character`
  # collect those film API urls, make a web request to each URL to get the info
  #  for that film
  characters = response_hash["results"]
      characters.each do |char|
      if char["name"] == character
        return char["films"]
      end

  end #end of get_character_movies_from_api method


# return value of this method should be collection of info about each film.
#  i.e. an array of hashes in which each hash reps a given film
# this collection will be the argument given to `parse_character_movies`
#  and that method will do some nice presentation stuff: puts out a list
#  of movies by title. play around with puts out other info about a given film.

def print_movies(films_array)
# some iteration magic and puts out the movies in a nice list
  films_array.each do |films|

## BONUS

# that `get_character_movies_from_api` method is probably pretty long. Does it do more than one job?
# can you split it up into helper methods?
